# Overview

A full [overview of entries can be found here [TODO]]()

An entry definition in the Delivery API contains a mixture of standard properties and properties that have been defined by the content type that an entry is based on. 

## Standard Properties

These are the standard properties that all entries have. The languageCode property is the indexer for the entry data as an entry can have multiple language variations which can be be edited and versioned independently using the Management API. In the Delivery API context only a single language variation is available on an entry.

| id | string | The entry identifier as GUID |
| contentTypeId | string  | The API identifier of the Content Type that the Entry is based on |
| projectId | string | The API identifer of the project the entry belongs to |
| dataFormat | string | Either 'entry' or 'asset' |
| [languageCode] | object | The container of the Entry data |
| [languageCode].version | object | Version information for the Entry | 
| [languageCode].version.created | string | The date the entry was created |
