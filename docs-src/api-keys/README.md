# API Key Management
API keys grant full access to the content types and entries for your project and should be protected the same way you would protect your password. In particular, there are a few common scenarios to keep in mind when working with API keys.

- Give each website/application its own API key, and provide a clear name and description to each key so you know what each key is used for. If a specific API key is compromised, you can disable that key without disabling access to all of your other applications.
- Be careful not to expose the key to the public (such as in screenshots, videos, or help documentation). Remember that blurring your data isn't always enough. It's best to use "cut" functions in your graphics program to remove the data completely.
- If a key needs to be shared, generate a new key and name it accordingly so it can be disabled, if needed. Never email the API key, because it would allow access to your content for a given project if hackers were to compromise your email account.
