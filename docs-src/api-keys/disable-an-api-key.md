# Disable an API key
If you think that an API key may have been compromised, or you no longer use the application that was accessing your content through a particular API key, you can disable that API key. 

1. Press the **Content Types & Entries** button in the sidebar. The *Content Types & Entries* drawer will open revealing a number of options.
2. Select **API Keys** from the drawer to open the *API Keys* list.
3. Find the API Key you want to disable in the list, and press **Edit**. The *Edit API key* screen will open.
4. Toggle the *API Key status* button to disable the API key.
5. Click **Update API Key** to save your changes. The API key will now be listed as disabled.

> **Warning:** Any application or website using this API key will expect it to be enabled to access itâ€™s content.
