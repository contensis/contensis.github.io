# Viewing API Keys
API keys provide a way to secure content types for your application. You can view the keys for the current project by navigating to the API keys listing screen.

## API Keys list
1. Press the **Content Types & Entries** button in the vertical toolbar. The drawer will open revealing a number of options.
2. Select **API Keys** from the drawer to open the API keys list.

## Filter content types
If you have a large number of API keys in your project then you may find it easier to search using the filter bar.

- Type a word in the filter bar to narrow down the API keys displayed.
