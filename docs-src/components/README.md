# Components overview

Components are groups of fields that can added to your content types as independent fields or be used multiple times when assigned to a composer field.

Think of components as a set of pre defined fields that bring input consistency to your authors across multiple content types.

A social component may contain the fields required to generate open graph metadata, such as title, description, image and author. Components are created using the component builder.
