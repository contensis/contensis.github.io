 # Add a component to a content type
You can add as many components to a content type as you want. Adding a component is the same as adding any other field type with the exception you have to select the type of component you want to include. 

## Add a component
With the content type open for editing:

1. Press the **Component** field type in the toolbox, a _Select a component_ window will open and display a list of components that can be added to the content type.
2. The component list allows you to select single or multiple components, each component selected will be indicated by a green check. Having selected the components you want to include in you content type, press **Add**.

  If you have a large number of components you can use the filter bar to locate the component you want to use.
3. The components will be added to the bottom of the content type, as per any other field type.

### Set a field name
The settings for a field will be displayed in the right hand panel when the field is active.

Give the field a name that clearly identifies its content. The field name is used to generate a sanitised field ID that a developer will use with the API. The field name will also be visible to an author when they are creating an entry.

## Component validation
You may notice that its not possible to set validation for a component field, this is because validation  is confirgured when adding fields to the component during the creation process.
