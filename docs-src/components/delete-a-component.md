# Delete a component
A component can only be deleted once it is no longer in use. The option to delete a component will be disabled if its currently in use, which is indicated by the [usage panel]. 

1.  Open the component you want to delete by pressing the **Edit** in the _Component listing_.
2.  When the _Component builder_ opens, the _Details_ for the component will be displayed in the right hand panel.
3.  Press **Delete**, a confirmation window will appear.
4.  To confirm deletion you will need to press  **I understand, delete the component**. The component will be permanently removed from your project.

> ** Warning**
> Deleting a component is irreversible, only do this if you are confident that it's no longer required.
