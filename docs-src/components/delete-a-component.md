# Delete a component
Deleting a content type will remove the content type as well as any entries that have been created, even if they are published.

1.  Open the component you want to delete by pressing the **Edit** in the _Component listing_ screen.
2.  When the _Component Builder_ opens, the _Details_ for the component will be displayed in the right hand panel.
3.  Press **Delete**, a confirmation window will appear.
4.  To confirm deletion you will need to type the component name in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
5.  Press **I understand, delete the component and its use in content types**. The component and its association to any content types will be completely and permanently removed from your project.

**Warning**: Deleting a component is irreversible, only do this if you are confident that it's no longer required.
