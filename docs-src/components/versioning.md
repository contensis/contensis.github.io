# Versioning
All changes to a component are recorded in version history. The version number will depend on the workflow state that the component is in. When a component is first created its version number will be 0.1.

## Saving a component

Each time a change is made to a component and saved the minor version number is incremented and the changes are recorded in a version history.

> _e.g._ Adding a field to a newly created component and pressing **Save** would increment the version number from 0.1 to 0.2.

## Publishing a component

When a component is ready for publishing, pressing **Publish** in the _Component builder_ will change the major version number.

> _e.g._ Having added all my fields to a newly created component and saved it. Pressing **Publish** increments the version number from 0.2 to 1.0 and changes the workflow state of the component to _Published_.
