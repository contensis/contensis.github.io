# Delete a content type
Deleting a content type will remove the content type definition as well as any entries that have been created for the content type, even if they are published.

> **Warning:** Deleting a content type and its entries is irreversible, only do this if you are confident that the entries and content type are not in use and are no longer required.

1. Open the content type you want to delete by pressing the edit icon in the content type listing screen.
2. When the content type builder opens, the settings for the content type are displayed in the right hand panel.
3. Press **Delete**, a delete confirmation window will be displayed.
4. To confirm the deletion of the content type you will need to type its name in the text box. This will enable the delete confirmation button.
