# Enable and disable languages for a content type
A content type is created in the default language of a project. If you have a multilingual license key, other languages supported by the project can be enabled for a content type.

## Enable additional languages

With the content type open for editing:

1. Press **Properties** to open the *Details* panel for the content type.
2. Select the **Languages** tab in the *Details* panel, you'll be presented with a list of languages supported by the project.
3. Toggle the languages you want to enable.
4. Press **Save** and **Publish** for the additional languages to be made available for the entries in your project.

Follow our article on [translating entries](/entries/translate-an-entry.md) to start writing content in another language.

## Disable a language
Disabling a language for a content type will prevent any further entries being created in that language. Any published entries that have been translated will still be available through the Delivery API until they are deleted.
