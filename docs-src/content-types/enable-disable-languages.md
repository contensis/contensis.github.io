# Enable and disable languages for a content type
The only language enabled against a content type when its created is the default language of the project. All other languages supported by the project are disabled until you enable the language against a content type. 

## Enable additional languages
When you want to enable additional languages for your content types you can do so in the properties panel of the content type builder. 

With the content type open for editing:

1. Press the cog icon to open the properties panel for the content type.
2. Select the languages tab in the panel, you'll be presented with a list of languages supported by the project.
3. Toggle the languages you want to enable.
4. Press **Save** and **Publish** for your changes to take affect.

Follow our article on [translating entries](/entries/translate-an-entry.md) to start writing content in another language.

## Disable a language
Disabling a language against a content type will prevent any further entries being created against that language. Any existing entries that have been translated will still be available through the Delivery API until they are deleted.
