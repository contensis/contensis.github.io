# Composer field editor

A composer field editor enables you to create multiple blocks of content within a single field.

When you add a composer field to a content type, you are setting up a container for supported fields, simply add the fields you want to support when the composer is active.

A composer field provides a richer editing experience for an author when used for areas like blogs, articles and how to guides.
