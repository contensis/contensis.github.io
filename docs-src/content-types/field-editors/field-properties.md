# Field properties

## Placeholder text
The placeholder property specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of a field.
 
> *e.g.* a sample value or a short description of the expected format

The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

## Help instructions
This property provides guidance to an author of the expected content that the field should contain. Where possible you should make sure you include instructions for every field in your content type. 

This will help clarify to an author what content you want added to a field.

The help instructions are shown below the field editor when an author is populating the field.

## Size
This property allows you to change the size of the rendered field editor when creating an entry. It usually changes the height of the editor to allow more content to be seen at the same time without needing to scroll.
