# Field Settings

## Display field
For a content type to be published it requires a single text field to be present.

The first text field added to the content type will be set as the display field, if you decide you want to use another field for your displayed field you can change it at a later date.

The display field is used in listings, the entry reference field editor and through the API to identify entries.
