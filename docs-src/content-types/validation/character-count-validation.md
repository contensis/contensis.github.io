# Character count
The *Character count* validation rule checks that the number of characters in a text field is within a specified range. You can define a range by setting the minimum and the maximum number value.

## How to set the validation
With a content type open for editing:

1. Select the field you want to set a character count rule for and select the **Validation** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2. Choose one of the following options from the *Number of characters* dropdown:

**Between** allows you to set the minimum and maximum values for an expected character range.

> *e.g.* Requires between 200 - 300 characters

**Minimum of** allows you to set an expected minimum value that needs to be met.

> *e.g.* Requires a minimum of 200 characters

**Maximum of** allows you to set the maximum number of characters that can be entered.

> *e.g.* Requires a maximum of 200 characters

- You can also provide an alternative validation message to be displayed when the field fails validation on publish, by entering it in the *Validation message* text box.
