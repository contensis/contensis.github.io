## How to set the validation
With a content type open for editing:

1. Select the field you want to set a character count rule for and pick the **Validation** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2. Choose one of the following options from the *Number of characters* dropdown:

  **Between** allows you to set the minimum and maximum values for an expected character range.

  > *e.g.* Requires between 200 - 300 characters

  **Minimum of** allows you to set an expected minimum value that needs to be met.

  > *e.g.* Requires a minimum of 200 characters

  **Maximum of** allows you to set the maximum number of characters that can be entered.

  > *e.g.* Requires a maximum of 200 characters

3. An alternative validation message can be added by entering it in the *Validation message* text box. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when published.
