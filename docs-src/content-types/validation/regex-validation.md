# Matches pattern
The *Matches pattern* validation method ensures that the value of a field matches a specific pattern defined by a regular expression.

A regular expression is a special text string for describing a search pattern. We use these expressions to validate the text that an author enters into a field of an entry.

## How to set the validation
With a content type open for editing:

1. Select the field you want to set a validation rule for and pick the **Validation** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2. Choose the required regular expression pattern you want to use from the *Matches pattern* dropdown, or define your own using the *Custom* option.
3. An alternative validation message can be added by entering it in the *Validation message* text box. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when published.

## Setting a custom expression
You can use the *Custom* option in the matches pattern dropdown to create your own. Using a handy library and expression checker like [Regular Expression 101](https://regex101.com/) to test your expression, makes things easier.

> **Note:** Expressions need to be written using the full JavaScript syntax to be valid.
