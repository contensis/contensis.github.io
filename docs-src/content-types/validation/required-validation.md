# Required
The *Required* validation rule checks that a published field contains a value. The field must contain a value for the entry to be saved.

## How to set the validation
With a content type open for editing:

1. Select the field you want to set a validation rule for and select the **Validation** tab from the *Field Settings* panel.
2. Change the *Required Field* toggle to true to make the field required.
3. An alternative validation message can be added by entering it in the *Validation message* text box. This will be displayed if the field fails validation when published.
