# Workflow
Content types exist in a workflow state. They have one of the following statuses, Draft, Awaiting Changes or Published.

## Draft
When a content type is created it is in the draft state until it has been published for the first time.

A **Draft** content type is indicated in a listing with a grey border or has a grey lozenge in the builder. 

Another indication that the item is in draft is that it has no major version in its version number *e.g.* 0.6.

## Awaiting changes
When a content type has been published at least once, and has had changes made to it and saved. Then the content type is placed into the Awaiting changes state until it is published.

It's effectively published and has a new draft state. 

A content type marked as **Awaiting changes** is indicated in a listing with an orange border or has a orange lozenge in the builder. 

Another indication that the item is in the Awaiting changes state is that it has major and minor number in its version number *e.g.* 1.6.[^1]

## Published
When a content type is published and has had no further changes made to it. The content type will be in the published state.

A content type marked as **Published** is indicated in a listing with a green border or has a green lozenge in the builder. 

Another indication that the item is in the Published state is that it only has a major number in its version number *e.g.* 2.0.
