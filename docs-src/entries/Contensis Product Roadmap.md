At Zengenti we are committed to executing iterative and rapid developments based on our product strategy for Contensis as well as feedback from our customers. These developments are delivered through two different release processes.

## Monthly updates
On the 1st Tuesday of every month we release a monthly update to Contensis which contains bug fixes and security improvements. 

We have a strict policy for the monthly update that no new features are released. This ensures that we arenâ€™t introducing any issues to an existing version. Any new features are released as part of a major release.

## Major releases 
On average a major release comes out every 6 months, around a common theme, giving our release a clear focus. We are working towards shorter release cycles, which we feel will bring the following advantages:

- Focussed releases.
- Opportunity to combine monthly updates with features.
- Shorter feedback cycle.
- Allows us to react quicker to market changes.
- User suggested features can be released sooner.
- Provides a better understanding of the release schedule.

## How we decide what goes into a release?
### Backlog
Our product team works in an Agile process, we work from a prioritised backlog. There are a number of sources that feed into the backlog.

#### Product board
Our product board sets the overall objectives for our products and is steered by our product strategy. The enables us to deliver a product that is focussed on our business goals as well as user need. 

Each of the individual sources of improvement and suggestions are fed into this process.

#### User suggestions
Existing clients are able to contribute their ideas to our product backlog by raising their suggestions through ZenHub. Ideas raised form part of our discussions of new features rather than the delivery of individual suggestions.

#### User research 
We spend time talking to users of Contensis both face to face and remotely. This may include remote based feedback sessions where user behaviour is captured on screen or by carrying out user testing of a new feature with customers face to face.

We periodically carry out user interviews with our internal and external customers to ensure that our personas align with our real customer landscape.

#### User groups
We run two user groups a year, as part of the user groups we have feedback sessions which focus on specific areas of Contensis which we are aiming to develop in the next 6 months.

This is an opportunity for users to sit down with the people developing Contensis and put forward their ideas.

#### Support forums
Our support forums are there to facilitate discussion between users of Contensis. Any recurring themes regarding features are drawn into the product backlog.

#### Internal stakeholders
As a company who uses our own product we have the opportunity to test out early features and development with people with varying degrees of knowledge and experience of Contensis. 

We work closely with our professional services team who provide feedback when implementing new client projects to ensure that using Contensis is efficient and a pleasure to use.
