# Create an entry
An entry is a piece of content that has been created from a content type. You can create unlimited entries against a content type. 

Follow the steps below to create an entry.

1. Press the **Content types and entries** button in the vertical toolbar. The drawer will open revealing a number of options.
2. Select **Entries** from the drawer to open the *Entries* listing screen.
3. Press the **New Entry** button, a list of content types will be displayed.
4. Select the content type from the listing that you want to create a new entry for. The entry editor will open for editing.
5. The fields in the entry editor can now be populated.
6. Press the **Save** button between any changes that have been made.
> The minor version will increment upon each save. Take a look at our [entry versioning](/entries/entry-versioning.md) article for a better understanding on how entries are versioned.

7. When you are ready to publish the entry press the **Publish** button.

> **Note:** The number of fields that need populating will vary between content types, depending on how they have been created. Some fields may be marked as required whilst other fields may expect the content captured to be in a particular format.
