# Viewing content entries
Content entries are created from content types and are stored against a project. You can view entries by navigating to the entries listing screen.

## Entries listing screen
- Press the **Content Types & Entries** button in the vertical toolbar. The drawer will open revealing a number of options.
- Select **Entries** from the drawer to open the entries listing screen.

## Filtering through entries
If you have a large number of entries in your project then you may find it easier to use the filter panel to narrow down the number of entries displayed.

The filtering options will vary depending on whether you have purchased a multilingual license. The options in the panel work together to build rich filters.

### Filter by content type
By default, the listing screen will display all entries for every content type in your project. You can narrow down the number of entries displayed by changing the content type dropdown from *All* to a specific content type in the list.

### Multiple languages
If you have a multilingual license then the entry listing screen will be filtered to all content types in your project for the master language.

### Filter by status
Entries exist in different [workflow states](/entries/workflow-states.md), you can choose a single entry status by selecting the status from the list of radio buttons.

### Filter by language *(licensed feature)*
When a multilingual license key is present in Contensis, then the ability to filter entries by language will be present in the entries listing screen.

You can filter the entries by changing the language in the dropdown. By default, the entries listing is filtered to the default language of the project.
