# Workflow states
Once created, *Entries* will always have one of the following workflow states: *Draft*, *Awaiting publish* or *Published*. If a multilingual license is present then the *Awaiting translation* and *Not yet translated* states will also be available.

## Draft
When an entry is created it is in the *Draft* state until it has been published for the first time and will be highlighted in grey.

Another indication that the item is in *Draft* is that it has no major version in its version number *e.g.* 0.6.

## Awaiting publish
When an entry has been published at least once, and has had changes made to it and saved, the entry will be *Awaiting publish* until it is published. It's an entry that is published and has new changes waiting to be published and will be highlighted in orange.

Another indication that the item is *Awaiting publish* is that it has major and minor numbers in its version number *e.g.* 1.6.

## Published
When an *Entry* is published and has had no further changes made to it, the *Entry* status will be *Published* and the highlight will be green.

Another indication that the item is in the Published state is that it only has a major number in its version number *e.g.* 2.0.

## Not yet translated *(licensed feature)*
When a language variation exists and its content has not yet been created then the entry will have the *Not yet translated* state.

## Awaiting translation *(licensed feature)*
When a language variation has a published version and changes to the master language have been made then the entry will have the *Awaiting translation* state.
