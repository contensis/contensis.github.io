# Create a project

If your license key supports multiple projects and you are logged in to Contensis as a System Administrator you can easily create new projects.

1. Creating a new project varies slightly depending on how many projects are in your system.

	**Single Project:** If you have a single project, select *create project* from the vertical navigation bar.

	**Multiple Projects:** If you already have multiple projects then creating a project is launched from the bottom of the project selector list.

	In both instances the *Project Setup* screen will open.

2. Give your project a unique name.

> This field is restricted to 64 characters.

3. The API name will automatically be created and sanitised from the project name you enter.

> **Note:** Its not possible to change the API name once you've created the project.

4. We automatically assign some default asset types that are commonly used. Add additional asset types that you need for your project by typing into the field and pressing enter. You can remove a type by pressing the cross icon next to the asset name.

5. Each project has a default language. If you have purchased the multilingual module you'll also be able to set which languages you want to support.

6. Having set the properties for your project and pressed *Create*, your project will be created and you'll be navigated to the dashboard of the new project.
