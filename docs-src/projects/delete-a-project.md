# Delete a project
A project can only be deleted by a System Administrator with access to the *Management Console*. Please bear in mind that deleting a project is irreversible. The only way to restore a project is from a database backup.

> **Note**: you must always have one project in Contensis. If you are attempting to delete the last project, then the *Delete* button described in these steps will not be displayed.

1. Ensure you are in the project you want to delete, by navigating to the project using the *Project selector* from the vertical toolbar.
2. Open the *Management Console* and select the *Project Overview* screen from the menu.
3. Press the **Delete** button in the project. A *Delete project* window will be displayed.
4. Type the project name into the text box. If the name entered into the text box matches the project name then the *Delete* button will be activated.
5. Confirm deletion by pressing the *I understand, delete the project* button
6. The project will be deleted and you'll be returned to the Contensis dashboard and taken to the first project you created.

> **Info**: When you delete a project from Contensis a cleanup process takes place overnight to remove the underlying project.
