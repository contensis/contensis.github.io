# Delete a project
A project can only be deleted by a System Administrator with access to the management console.

To delete a project follow the steps, please bear in mind that deleting a project is irreversible. The only way to restore a project is from a database backup.

> **Note**: you must always have one project in Contensis. If you are attempting to delete the last project, then the delete button described in the steps will not be present.

1. Ensure you are in the project you want to delete, by navigating to the project using the project selector from the vertical toolbar.
2. Open the management console and select the Project Overview screen from the menu.
2. Press the delete button against the project. You'll be prompted with a delete project modal window.
3. To delete the project you need to enter the project name in to the text box
4. If the name entered into the text box matches the project name then the delete button will be activated.
5. Confirm deletion by pressing the *I understand, delete the project* button
6. The project will be deleted and you'll be returned to the Contensis dashboard and taken to the fist project you created.

> **Info**: When you delete a project from Contensis a cleanup process takes place overnight to remove the underlying project.
