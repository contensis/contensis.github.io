# Create a project

If your license key supports multiple projects and you are logged in to Contensis as a System Administrator you can easily create new projects.

1. Creating a new project varies slightly to how many projects are in your system. 

	**Single Project:** If you have a single project select create project from the vertical navigation bar. 
	
	**Multiple Projects:** If you already have multiple projects then creating a project is launched from the bottom of the project selector list.

	In both instances the *Project Setup* screen will open.

2. A project requires a unique name and API name and a default language to be set. We'll automatically generate a sanitised API name from the project name you have entered.

 > Its not possible to change the API name once you've created the project. 

3. **Assets**
We automatically assign some default asset types that are common across sites. Add or remove additional asset types that you need for your project.

4. **Languages**
Each project has a default language. If you have a multi language license key you'll also be able to set what languages you want to support.

5. Having set the properties for your project and press *Create*, your project will be created and you'll be navigated to the dashboard of the new project.
