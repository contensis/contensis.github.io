# Daily standup

- Ideally Si / Rich need to divide their time across the morning stand ups
- Time box the morning standup to 15 minutes max
- Refresh the items on what the standup is for
	- Worked on towards the sprint goals
	- Impediments / questions and clarification (PO/SM)
	- **NOT** a place to go into the technical details
- Introduce a standup for team buzz (Jon, Si, Rich, Scott)
	- Get Scott to focus on his Architectural Commitments / Focus

> The stand up is to communicate, not solve
