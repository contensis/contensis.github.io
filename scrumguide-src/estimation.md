# Estimation
Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work. We use this method as our experience has shown that estimating backlog items in time has shown inaccurate results.

A good primer to estimating with story points can be found on [Mike Cohns blog](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points).

## Product team baseline
Over time we've refined our understanding of effort and use this common scale as a means to support our estimation for our teams.

| Story points | Baseline time range |
|:--|:--|
| 0 | 0 |
| 1/2 | 30mins - 1hr |
| 1 | 1hr - 2hrs |
| 2 | 2hr - 4hrs |
| 3 | 4hrs - 1 day |
| 5 | 1 day - 1.5 days |
| 8 | 1.5 days - 3 days |
| 13 | 2 days - 3 days |
| 20/40/100 | Break it down |
| ? | Take a break |
