# Planning
- Starting planning with an estimated backlog
- Clear understanding of the sprint goal
- Drilling out the tasks for the backlog items not in granular detail, leave that for the implementation
- Draw items into the sprint
- Make a commitment to deliver
- Estimate any new tasks to fulfil the sprint goal

- [ ] Report on tasks at start / tasks at end of a sprint to see how much they have changed
