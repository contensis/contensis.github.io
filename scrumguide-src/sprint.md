# The sprint

- Any scope change needs to be run through PO
	- Is everything at done
	- Does what you want to draw in relate to the sprint goal
	- Are your demos complete
- Introduce a new done column to JIRA workflow 'Awaiting PO acceptance'
- Ensure risker items/stories are delivered in earlier sprints
