# The development team

The development team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the development team create the product increment.

Development teams are structured and empowered by the organisation to organise and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimises the development team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Development teams have the following characteristics:

- They are self-organising. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the development team how to turn product backlog into product increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development teams should be cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product increment;
- Scrum recognises no sub-teams in the development team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule; and,
- Individual development team members may have specialised skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the development team as a whole.
