# Product owner
The Product Owner is responsible for maximising the value of the product and the work of the development team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The product owner is the sole person responsible for managing the product backlog. Product backlog management includes:

- Clearly expressing product backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the product backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Optimising the value of the work the development team performs;
- Ensuring that the product backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the scrum team will work on next
- Ensuring the development team understands items in the product backlog to the level needed.

The product owner may do the above work, or work with the development Team do it. However, the Product Owner remains accountable.

The product owner is one person, not a committee. The product owner may represent the desires of a committee in the product backlog, but those wanting to change a product backlog item’s priority must address the product owner.

For the product owner to succeed, the entire organisation must respect his or her decisions. The product owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the product backlog. No one is allowed to tell the development team to work from a different set of requirements, and the development team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.
