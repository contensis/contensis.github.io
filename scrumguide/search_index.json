Only members of the development team create the product increment.\nDevelopment teams are structured and empowered by the organisation to organise and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimises the development team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness.\nDevelopment teams have the following characteristics:\n\nThey are self-organising. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the development team how to turn product backlog into product increments of potentially releasable functionality;\nDevelopment teams should be cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product increment;\nScrum recognises no sub-teams in the development team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule; and,\nIndividual development team members may have specialised skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the development team as a whole.\n\n"},"sprint.html":{"url":"sprint.html","title":"The sprint","keywords":"","body":"The sprint\n\nAny scope change needs to be run through PO\nIs everything at done\nDoes what you want to draw in relate to the sprint goal\nAre your demos complete\n\n\nIntroduce a new done column to JIRA workflow 'Awaiting PO acceptance'\nEnsure risker items/stories are delivered in earlier sprints\n\n"},"sprint-planning.html":{"url":"sprint-planning.html","title":"Sprint planning","keywords":"","body":"Planning\n\nStarting planning with an estimated backlog\nClear understanding of the sprint goal\nDrilling out the tasks for the backlog items not in granular detail, leave that for the implementation\nDraw items into the sprint\nMake a commitment to deliver\nEstimate any new tasks to fulfil the sprint goal\n\n[ ] Report on tasks at start / tasks at end of a sprint to see how much they have changed\n\n\n"},"daily-standup.html":{"url":"daily-standup.html","title":"Daily standup","keywords":"","body":"Daily standup\n\nIdeally Si / Rich need to divide their time across the morning stand ups\nTime box the morning standup to 15 minutes max\nRefresh the items on what the standup is for\nWorked on towards the sprint goals\nImpediments / questions and clarification (PO/SM)\nNOT a place to go into the technical details\n\n\nIntroduce a standup for team buzz (Jon, Si, Rich, Scott)\nGet Scott to focus on his Architectural Commitments / Focus\n\n\n\n\nThe stand up is to communicate, not solve\n\n"},"sprint-review.html":{"url":"sprint-review.html","title":"Sprint review","keywords":"","body":"Sprint review\n\nEnsure that the review is no longer than two hours.\nEnsure that any suggestions/feedback to improve the product value, inline with the release goal should be added to the product backlog.\nOnly when it brings real product value\n\n\nAll items should be demoable\nA full user scenario\nPartial implementation -
