## Layout
A good rule of thumb is to consider your mobile readers from the start. 
Do you like swiping through pages of text when reading on a smartphone? Didn’t think so.

## Blocks of text
- Avoid having more than 2 or 3 paragraphs in succession without a break.
- Use images, lists and pull-quotes to break up the page.
- Use sub headings every few paragraphs to provide structure to the document and to aid skim reading.

## Bullet lists
- Avoid long lists in a paragraph - use bulleted lists instead.
- If a bullet wraps onto more than one line then shorten it or add it to a paragraph.
- Be consistent about adding full stops at the end of a bullet – don’t unless it’s a sentence.
- Be consistent about using capitals at the start of a bullet – don’t unless it’s a sentence.
- If the list is too long (15+) then split the list into two or more sub categories.
