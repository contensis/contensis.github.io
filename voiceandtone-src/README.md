# Our Zengenti voice and tone

We write for our users. Though our voice doesn’t change much, our tone adapts to our users’ feelings.

## Blogs
- Sound human, and show our personality as a company without getting in the way.
- Don’t market features – explain them.
- Every post should teach readers something. Enlighten them with extra links, tips, and information that makes them smarter – or sneak peeks into our company personality.

## Slack responses
- Offer a solution or next step.
- Find opportunities to sound positive, mention new features and encourage users to upgrade.
- Show willingness and make it clear that we are there for them.
- Be tactful when letting users know that what they are asking for is really a work request.

## Forms
- Use plain language and common terms to describe form fields.
- Help readers understand the information you’re asking for.
- Don't ask for information we won't use.
- Make the process as quick as possible.

## Formal writing (e.g. contracts)
- Be thorough. 
- Provide examples and explanations, not summaries. 
- Include links to relevant resources.
- Write as calmly and clearly as you can. Avoid jargon.
- Don’t dumb anything down or joke around.

## Incident messages
- Offer a solution or next step.
- Be straightforward. Explain what’s going on asap.
- Be calm. Don’t use exclamation points and be sparing with your use of alarming words like “alert” or "immediately."
- Be serious. Don’t joke around with people who are frustrated.

## Social media posts
- Get to the point. You have 140 characters in an endless stream of tweets, and people are busy.
- Delight our followers with good news when you can.
- Be appropriate.
- During major news events, turn off scheduled and promoted tweets.
- Do not post personal or political views on our channels.

## Sales copy
- Use the latest information about Contensis.
- Keep technical terms consistent.
- Don't assume the recipient knows anything about Zengenti or Contensis.
- Don't slate our competitors.

## Website text
- Be confident in explaining why Contensis is great. 
- Be specific about Contensis’s features, so people can make their own comparisons.
- Delight people with design, data, and helpful information about Contensis.
- Relay our personality and sense of humor, but don’t go crazy (think clever, not silly).

## ZenHub articles
- Be straightforward. Your priority is to answer questions and inform readers so they can get back to work.
- Be an educator, not a salesperson. 
- Show people how easy it is to use Contensis.
- Keep the language and style consistent across articles – don't innovate when we need clarity.
