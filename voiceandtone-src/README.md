# Our Zengenti voice and tone

Before you write for Zengenti, it’s important to think about our users. Though our voice doesn’t change much, our tone adapts to our users’ feelings.

## Top tips for website text:
- Be confident in explaining why Contensis is so great. 
- Be specific about Contensis’s features, so people can make their own comparisons.
- Delight people with design, data, and helpful information about Contensis.
- Relay our personality and sense of humor, but don’t go crazy (think clever, not silly).

## Top tips for ZenHub articles:
- Be straightforward. Your priority is to answer questions and inform readers so they can get back to work.
- Be an educator, not a salesperson. Show people how easy it is to use Contensis.
- Keep your language and style consistent across articles.

## Top tips for forum responses:
- Offer a solution or next step.
- Find opportunities to sound positive, mention new features and encourage users to upgrade.
- Show willing and make it clear that we are there for our customers.

## Top tip for forms:
- Use plain language and common terms to describe form fields.
- Help readers understand the information you’re asking for.
- Don't ask for information we won't use, make the process as quick as possible.

## Top tips for formal writing:
- Be thorough. Provide examples and explanations, not summaries. Include links to relevant resources.
- Write as calmly and clearly as possible, within the obvious constraints. Only use legal jargon when it’s absolutely necessary.

## Top tips for blogs:
- Sound human, and relay Zengenti’s personality without getting in the way.
- Don’t market features—explain them.
- Every blog should teach readers something. Enlighten them with extra links, tips, information that makes them smarter, or sneak peeks into our company personality.

## Top tips for social media posts:
- Get to the point. You have 140 characters in an endless stream of tweets, and people are busy.
- Delight our followers with good news when you can.
- Be appropriate. During major news events, turn off scheduled and promoted tweets. Do not post personal or political views on any company social media channel.

## Top tips for incident messages:
- Offer a solution or next step.
- Be straightforward. Explain what’s going on asap.
- Be calm. Don’t use exclamation points and be sparing with your use of alarming words like “alert” or "immediately."
- Be serious. Don’t joke around with people who are frustrated.
