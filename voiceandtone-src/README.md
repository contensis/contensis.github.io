# Our Zengenti style

Before you write for Zengenti, it’s important to think about our users. 

We always put our user’s needs first. You need to figure out what they want, and deliver it in an easily digestible format. It’s not enough to merely provide information. You need to do everything you can to make sure everyone gets your message. Never worry that you’ve simplified something too much. It’s better that a few people think your writing is too simple but everyone understands it, than to
have a few people think you’re clever but hardly anybody gets your point.

Writing clear, plain-language text is simply a good idea, but it also supports a wider range of users. Avoid jargon and idiomatic language (words and phrases that only work for specific groups of people) to give multilingual people a better chance of getting your message. It also helps people who are in a rush. Also, remember that the Contensis community is bigger than Zengenti, so in-jokes, acronyms,
and company jargon mean nothing to people outside the company.

Top tips for website text:
- Be confident in explaining why Contensis is so great. 
- Be specific about Contensis’s features, so people can make their own comparisons.
- Delight people with design, data, and helpful information about Contensis.
- Relay our personality and sense of humor, but don’t go crazy (think clever, not silly).

Top tips for ZenHub articles:
- Be straightforward. Your priority is to answer questions and inform readers so they can get back to work.
- Be an educator, not a salesperson. Show people how easy it is to use Contensis.
- Keep your language and style consistent across articles.

Top tip for forms:
- Use plain language and common terms to describe form fields.
- Help readers understand the information you’re asking for.
- Don't ask for information we won't use, make the process as quick as possible.

Top tips for formal writing:
- Be thorough. Provide examples and explanations, not summaries. Include links to relevant resources.
- Write as calmly and clearly as possible, within the obvious constraints. Only use legal jargon when it’s absolutely necessary.
- Don’t dumb anything down or joke around. This type of writing is serious business and we can be held to account on it.

Top tips for blogs:
- Sound human, and relay Zengenti’s personality without getting in the way.
- Don’t market features—explain them.
- Every blog should teach readers something. Enlighten them with extra links, tips, information that makes them smarter, or sneak peeks into our company personality.

Top tips for social media posts:
- Get to the point. You have 140 characters in an endless stream of tweets, and people are busy.
- Delight our followers with good news when you can.
- Be appropriate. During major news events, turn off scheduled and promoted tweets. Do not post personal or political views on any company social media channel.

Top tips for incident messages:
- Offer a solution or next step.
- Be straightforward. Explain what’s going on asap.
- Be calm. Don’t use exclamation points or alarming words like “alert” or "immediately."
- Be serious. Don’t joke around with people who are frustrated.
