# The Contensis community Slack channel

This is where our users can talk to each other. We encourage existing clients to ask questions and share ideas with other Contensis users, designers and developers. We dip in when we can to help out if a question is not being answered and we moderate any unhelpful behaviour.   

## Staff etiquette
- The Contensis Slack channel is a a public-facing channel, so no internal work or personal stuff on there please - definately no turd emojis, off-colour jokes, gratuitous gifs etc. We can be informal, but never unprofessional.
- Sign up with your full first and last names so you can be found in the member directory and smart photo eg. your staff photo. The best way to show we are from Zengenti is to add it to your last name eg. Lambert - Zengenti. In the 'What I do' section of your user profile please add your job title.
- If you know the answer to a query, answer it straight in the main post. If it will require further discussion create a sub thread.
- Try to answer queries publicly - don’t initiate private messages or channels unless the client is complaining.
- If the query sounds like it should be answered as a helpdesk ticket or is a work order, ask them to do this or raise it for them.
- Use the code snippet widget rather than posting code direct into the channel. Give your code a title and indicate the type as much as possible, so it can be pulled later and possibly included in a code library.
- If you are not sure how to do something - use our sandbox Slack team to test it out here first: https://zenslackpilot.slack.com/home

## Expectation management for clients
- This is not a backdoor to the helpdesk or a way to extend PS support.
- We won’t answer all queries. This is place for users to answer each other's queries and we will dip in and out as we currently do with the forums (do try to help out if people are being ignored though).
- We are not committing ourselves to instant chat.
- We will have default ‘do not disturb’ hours - 09:00 - 17:00.
- The aim is that the community will become
