## Listing
A listing provides a way to display large volumes of content in a screen. We use two common types although there are three versions in use today.

### Basic listing
A basic listing is usually used when there are 100 items or less and does not require pagination.

### Table listing
A table listing is usually used when there are over 100 items, requires pagination and more detailed information needs to be displayed against each item.

### Grid
A grid is widely used in Contensis and is most commonly seen in the management console. It's slowly being replaced with basic and table listings. It provides a similar pattern to the table listing.
