# Write simply and directly
Use simple, direct language that is easy for users to understand.

## Common introductory phrases may be omitted.

| Do | Don't |
|:--|:--|
| Save changes? | Would you like to save your changes? |
| Entry deleted | Your entry has been deleted |
| Entry published | Your entry has been published |

## Write for all levels of readers
Pick common words that are clearly and easily understandable to both beginning and advanced English readers.

Avoid industry-specific terminology or names invented for UI features.

| Do | Don't |
|:--|:--|
| Turn on status bar | Enable status bar |

## Begin with the objective

If a sentence describes both an objective and the action needed to achieve that objective, start the sentence with the objective.

## Reveal detail only as needed

It's not necessary to describe every detail in the first interaction. Reveal increasing detail about features as the user explores them and needs the information.

# Tone
## Be friendly, respectful, and focus on the user

Text in your UI should complement your visual UI: intuitive, efficient, casual, and trustworthy. Charm peeks through, but never upstages the user.

## Be humble
Don’t brag or over-promise. Reveal what a feature does, don’t say how great it is.

## Be inviting
Focus on the benefits of each feature. Omit implementation details, caveats, and restrictions at the entry points to features (buttons, menu items, links, and promotions).

## Be positive
Present information in a positive light: it’s reassuring.

## Be essential
For every message, ask yourself: does the user really need to know this? Err on the side of letting users stay focused on their own tasks. Sometimes the most effective UI is no text at all.

Avoid messages that suggest that it’s surprising or unusual that a user’s simple action was successful.

## Use sentence-style caps
Use sentence-style caps for all titles, headings, labels, menu items – any place that considered for “Title-Style Caps.”

Avoid capitalizing all letters except where the material spec requires them, such as the Button style.

## Capitalize product names appropriately
Only capitalize product names when referring to a product as a product. Don’t capitalize the things you create or work with when using that product.

## Skip periods and other unnecessary punctuation
To help readers scan text at a glance, avoid using periods and other unnecessary punctuation.

## Periods

You should skip periods in solo sentences (or phrases) in these UI elements:

- Labels
- Hover text
- Bulleted lists
- Dialog body text
Periods should be used for:

- All items in a bulleted list, if any bullet contains multiple sentences
- Sentences followed by a link (place the period before the link, not after)
- Dialogs with multiple sentences

## Use contractions

Don't make a sentence harder to understand just to follow this rule. For example, "do not" can give more emphasis than "don't" when needed.

## Avoid exclamation points

Exclamation points should be avoided as they could come across as shouting.

## “1, 2, 3” not “one, two, three”
Use numerals in place of words for numbers.

One exception is when mixing uses of numbers, such as "Enter two 3s."
