# Text Layout
## Headings
Follow semantic headings. So, a heading 1 is followed by a heading 2 – and not a heading 3, 4, or 5.

**We use sentence-case capitalisation** in headings instead of title case. So, capitalise the first word (and any proper nouns), but not every word in a heading:

Sentence-case examples:
- Running a user-experience workshop
- Using CSS for site layout
- Creating Contensis templates

Title-case examples to avoid:
- Finding the Right People for your Team
- Inserting Scripts into a Template

## Paragraphs
Use blank lines to demarcate paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a paragraph.

## Bullet Lists
Use bullet lists where appropriate, but don't shoehorn a paragraph into a list.

Keep the listed items in the same part of speech:

For example, if you want to say that new features include a list of things, don't do this:

- The Forms builder lets you create customisable forms
- Managing links
- Form element styling
- Emailing notifications

**Do this, instead:**

- Link management
- Form element styling
- Email notifications

# Emphasis
- Use bold to indicate Contensis specific buttons e.g. Submit & Approve
- Use Italics only for natural emphasis or to refer to sections/areas of Contensis eg. Management Console
- Use  monospaced fonts for short code snippets and settings. Use gists for longer bits of code.
- Don’t use quotation marks, unless they’re wrapped around direct speech (this will be unlikely to be done in knowledge base articles), or indicate string literals in code
- Never underline anything
