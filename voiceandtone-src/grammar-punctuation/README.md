## Acronyms and abbreviations
For abbreviations of technical terms, introduce the full phrase before using its acronym. For example, we can talk about information architecture (IA), then use IA when appropriate. Some acronyms have become the term for the thing, so there are exceptions.

**Exceptions:**
- HTML – all caps
- CSS – all caps
- HTTP – all caps 

Avoid these acronyms, because they are unclear or are internal jargon:
- PS (meaning professional services)
- CS (meaning content strategy)

For the sake of clarity, do not overuse *i.e* and *e.g.* If you must use them, [here's a nice explanation](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ie) of how it's done.

We use *e.g.* or *i.e.* not *e.g.,* or *i.e.,*

## Ampersands (&)
Use the word *and* instead of an ampersand (&) when you're writing. Ampersands can be used in code blocks.

## Apostrophes
The apostrophe’s most common job is making a word possessive – Jon's desk means Jon possesses his desk. If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an ‘s. If the word ends in an s because it's plural, just add an apostrophe.

- The doughnut thief ate Sam’s doughnut.
- The doughnut thief ate Chris’s doughnut.
- The doughnut thief ate the managers’ doughnuts. (The doughnuts belonged to more than one manager.)

Apostrophes are also used to show where letters have been replaced in abbreviations – *do not* becomes *don't*. This is sometimes tricky with the word *it*. Use *it's* to mean *it is*, and *its* when *it* needs to be possessive:

*It's doing its job.*

## Capitalisation
Capitalise these things:

- Proper nouns (the names of specific people, places, or organisations)
- The first word of a complete sentence
- The letter *i* when used as a word (I like the letter i.)
- The letters of acronyms unless they are normally lower-case (for example, CSS)
- The first word in numbered or bulleted lists
- The name of a key on the keyboard
- The first word in a heading or title
- Button text in the Contensis UI if they are capitalised in the button (e.g. **Save**, **Submit & Approve**)

Headings, titles, and menu options should be sentence case (capitalise the first word, and any proper nouns).

Do not capitalise these things:

- Words for products and services unless they're proper nouns (Quality Assurance Module is one of our modules)
- Words for departments (professional services, marketing, product)
- Job titles (head of marketing) unless they form part of a name (which is rare in business): Professor John Smith is a professor
- Seasons (spring, winter, autumn, summer)
- Compass points (north, south, east, west)

Never use capitals to draw attention to words. Don't do this:

*We stand by our Products and Services.*


## Colons
A colon (:) means something follows. You never need a colon and a dash (:-). Do not use a semicolon when you meant to use a colon.

> Our services include:
> 
> * User-experience design
> * Content strategy
> * Graphic design
> * Template development
> * Front-end development

## Commas
Use commas when you need a pause. Also, use them when beginning a sentence with things like: also, so, and when-phrases like when using this,. Commas are used to break up lists of words. So we can list apples, oranges, and bananas. Use them to stack adjectives up like handy, resourceful phrases.

**We use the Oxford comma**, which means that when stacking up comma-separated words, we put a comma between the last two items in the list:

*Oxford comma:*
We like to use CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.

*Non-Oxford comma:*
We like to use CSS, JavaScript and HTML.

## Dashes and hyphens
There are two common flavours of dashes: the hyphen (-) and the en-dash (–).

Hyphens are used to hyphenate, like in the name en-dash, or for compound adjectives like (out-of-the-box). En-dashes are used to interrupt sentences – like this. They're handy, but shouldn't be overused, or your text will become distracting.

Use hyphens when using multiple-word adjectives:

*This is our professional-services team.*

But not when it’s just a noun:

*You can use our professional services.*


## Ellipsis
The ellipsis (…) shows where words are removed. It's usually used in quotations. It's not a common punctuation point, so you're unlikely to need to use one. It's sometimes used to show a pause in narrative text, so it might crop up in blog posts. It's ok to use three full-stops without spaces (...). But, don't overuse it, or your text will appear... <- unfinished.

## Exclamation points
Exclamation points (!) show strong emotion – they literally mean the previous words are shouted or exclaimed. Don't use them unless absolutely necessary.

They're fine in code blocks (where they're called *bangs* like in hash bang: #!). 

## Gilding
Gilding is choosing complex, uncommon words when there are simpler, more common alternatives. Here is a list of words to avoid, with some possible alternatives:

- Achieve – meet, do
- Operate – run
- Solutions – systems, answers, products, services
- Action  – do


## Jargon
Jargon is language that’s overused in a community. At Zengenti, we tend to run into two particular forms: corporate and technical jargon. **We don’t like jargon.**

Avoid corporate jargon:

- Leverage – when used as a verb: we leverage CSS
- Utilise
- Going forward
- Solutions
- Ourselves (and other reflexive pronouns: yourself/selves)

Often, the most useful word is a technical term. It’s not jargon if it’s the best word for a concept. But, we need to consider non-technical readers. So, it’s usually fine to use server, because most people will understand it. But, if we’re talking about using SANs for cloud hosting, we should explain what they are.

## Numbers
- For numbers under 10, spell out the number. For all numbers 10 and over, use the numeral.
- For numerals over 999 - use a comma every three spaces for clarity: 9,000 or 9,999,999
- Spell out common fractions like one quarter.
- Use a 0 where there’s no digit before the decimal point – 0.99.
- Use to instead of a dash to show a range (*500 to 900* and not *500-900*), except in tables.
- Use MB for anything over 1MB: 4MB not 4096KB.
- Use KB for anything under 1MB: 569KB not 0.55MB.
- For addresses, use *to* in ranges: 49 to 53 Cherry Street.

### Dates
- Capitalise months: January, February, March
- Don’t use a comma between the month and year: 14 June 2012
- When space is an issue - in tables or publication titles, for example - you can use truncated months: Jan, Feb
- Use *to* in date ranges (2015 to 2016, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm)

### Money
The currency sign goes before the amount: £45 or $56. Make sure to use both decimal places if pence are involved: £45.90.

### Time
Use *am* and *pm* (9am, 12pm). If you need minutes, use a colon (9:30am). It's also acceptable to use the 24-hr clock, but you need a colon every time (13:00).

## Periods or full-stops
Full stops (in America, they're called periods) end sentences that don't raise questions. The same button that makes a . also makes a decimal point in numbers (12.849). They're the same character, but called a full-stop for sentences, and a decimal point (or just point) for numbers.

## Question marks
Question marks turn a sentence into a question. Use them when you ask a question. Don't overuse question and answer style constructions in your writing: Do we want to overuse questions? Of course not!

## Quotation marks
Quotation marks only mark quotes. Don't use them to draw attention to a "word." Use italics (\<em> ... \</em>) when you need to indicate a specific *word*. We use the British system of quotes, using a single quote, then a double for a quote within a quote:

Jon Lewis said: 'I asked him whether he liked it, and he said: "Yes, indeed I do."'

Use blockquotes when quoting more than a line or two – this is common in testimonials.

> We love using Contensis for our website. It has changed the way we run our organisation, and it's brought much joy to the very nature of our field. We've seen an increase of 10,000% in our productivity. I cannot recommend it enough. - Jon Lewis, Ludlow University

Quotation marks can indicate string literals in code: "ContentNode".


## Semicolons
Semicolons (;) are used to join independent clauses in sentences. That means that they're not often used; and if they are, they're used sparingly. It is almost always better to write two simpler sentences.
