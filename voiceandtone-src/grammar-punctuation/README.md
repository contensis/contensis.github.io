## Acronyms and abbreviations
For most technical terms that use abbreviations, introduce the full phrase before using its acronym. For example, we can talk about information architecture (IA), then use IA whenever appropriate.

**Exceptions:**
- HTML – all caps
- CSS – all caps

Avoid these acronyms, because they are unclear or are internal jargon:
- PS (meaning professional services)

For the sake of clarity, avoid using i.e and e.g. If you must use them, [here's a nice explanation](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ie) of how it's done.

We use e.g. or i.e. not e.g., or i.e.,

## Apostrophes
The apostrophe’s most common use is making a word possessive. If the word already ends in an s and it’s singular, you also add an ‘s. If the word ends in an s and is plural, just add an apostrophe.

- The donut thief ate Sam’s donut.
- The donut thief ate Chris’s donut.
- The donut thief ate the managers’ donuts.

# Capitalisation
Capitalise these things:

- Proper nouns
- The first word of a complete sentence
- The letters of abbreviations and acronyms unless they are normally lowercase
- The first word in numbered or bulleted lists
- The name of a key on the keyboard
- The first word in a heading or title – all headings, titles, and menu options should be sentence case (capitalise the first word, and any proper nouns)
- Capitalise text referring to buttons in the Contensis UI if they are capitalised in the button itself (e.g. **Save**, **Submit & Approve**)

## Colons
A colon (:) means something follows. Use it if you say something like: this. You never need a colon and a dash (:-). Do not use a semicolon when you meant to use a colon.

## Commas
Use commas when you need a pause. Also, use them when beginning a sentence with things like: also, so, and when-phrases like when using this,. Commas are used to break up lists of words. So we can list apples, oranges, and bananas. Use them to stack adjectives up like handy, resourceful phrases.

**We use the Oxford comma**, which means that when stacking up comma-separated words, we put a comma between the last two items in the list:

**Oxford comma:**
We like to use CSS, Javascript, and HTML.

**Non-Oxford comma:**
We like to use CSS, Javascript and HTML.

## Dashes and hyphens
There are two common flavours of dashes: the hyphen (-) and the en-dash (–).

Hyphens are used to hyphenate – like in the name en-dash, or for compound adjectives like (out-of-the-box). En-dashes are used to interrupt sentences – like this. They're handy, but shouldn't be overused, or your text will appear stilted.

Use hyphens when using multiple-word adjectives:

*This is our professional-services team.*

But not when it’s just a noun:

*You can hire our professional services.*

## Gilding
Gilding is choosing complex, uncommon words when there are simpler, more common alternatives. Here is a list of words to avoid, with some possible alternatives

- Achieve – meet, do
- Operate – run

## Jargon
Jargon is language that’s overused in a community. At Zengenti, we tend to run into two particular forms: corporate and technical jargon. **We don’t like jargon**.

Avoid corporate jargon:

- Leverage – when used as a verb: we leverage CSS
- Utilise
- Going forward
- Solutions
- Ourselves (and other reflexive pronouns: yourself/selves)

Often, the most useful word is a technical term. It’s not jargon if it’s the best word for a concept. But, we need to consider non-technical readers. So, it’s usually fine to use HTML, because most people will understand it. But, if we’re talking about using SANs for cloud hosting, we should explain what they are.

## Quotation marks
Don’t use quotation marks, unless they’re wrapped around direct speech (this will be unlikely to be done in knowledge base articles), or indicate string literals in code.


## Semicolons
Semicolons (;) are used to join independent clauses in sentences. That means that they're not often used; and if they are, they're used sparingly. It is almost always better to write two simpler sentences.
