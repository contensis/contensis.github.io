# Capitalisation
Capitalise these things:

- Proper nouns
- The first word of a complete sentence
- The letters of abbreviations and acronyms unless they are normally lowercase
- The first word in numbered or bulleted lists
- The name of a key on the keyboard
- The first word in a heading or title â€“ all headings, titles, and menu options should be sentence case (capitalise the first word, and any proper nouns)
- Capitalise text referring to buttons in the Contensis UI if they are capitalised in the button itself (e.g. **Save**, **Submit & Approve**)
