# Jargon and gilding
Jargon is language that’s overused in a community. At Zengenti, we tend to run into two particular forms: corporate and technical jargon. We don’t like jargon.

Avoid corporate jargon:

- Leverage – when used as a verb: we leverage CSS
- Utilise
- Going forward
- Solutions
- Ourselves (and other reflexive pronouns: yourself/selves)

Often, the most useful word is a technical term. It’s not jargon if it’s the best word for a concept. But, we need to consider non-technical readers. So, it’s usually fine to use HTML, because most people will understand it. But, if we’re talking about using SANs for cloud hosting, we should explain what they are.

Gilding is choosing complex, uncommon words when there are simpler, more common alternatives. Here is a list of words to avoid, with some possible alternatives

- Achieve – meet, do
- Operate – run
