# Punctuation
## Commas
Use commas when you need a pause. Also, use them when beginning a sentence with things like: also, so, and when-phrases like when using this,. Commas are used to break up lists of words. So we can list apples, oranges, and bananas. Use them to stack adjectives up like handy, resourceful phrases.

**We use the Oxford comma**, which means that when stacking up comma-separated words, we put a comma between the last two items in the list:

**Oxford comma:**
We like to use CSS, Javascript, and HTML.

**Non-Oxford comma:**
We like to use CSS, Javascript and HTML.

## Colons and semicolons
A colon (:) means something follows. Use it if you say something like: this. You never need a colon and a dash (:-). Do not use a semicolon when you meant to use a colon.

Semicolons (;) are used to join independent clauses in sentences. That means that they're not often used; and if they are, they're used sparingly. It is almost always better to write two simpler sentences.

## Dashes and hyphens
There are two common flavours of dashes: the hyphen (-) and the en-dash (–). 

Hyphens are used to hyphenate – like in the name en-dash, or for compound adjectives like (out-of-the-box). En-dashes are used to interrupt sentences – like this. They're handy, but shouldn't be overused, or your text will appear stilted.

Use hyphens when using multiple-word adjectives:

*This is our professional-services team.*

But not when it’s just a noun:

*You can hire our professional services.*
