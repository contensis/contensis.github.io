## Bullet lists
Use bullet lists where appropriate, but don't shoehorn a paragraph into a list. Keep the listed items in the same part of speech. 
For example, if you want to say that new features include a list of things, don't do this:

- The Forms builder lets you create customisable forms
- Managing links
- Form element styling
- Emailing notifications

**Do this, instead:**

- Link management
- Form element styling
- Email notifications

- If a bullet wraps onto more than one line then shorten it or add it to a paragraph
- Be consistent about adding full stops at the end of a bullet – don’t unless it’s a sentence.
- Be consistent about using capitals at the start of a bullet - don’t unless it’s a sentence.
- If the list is too long (15+) then split the list into two or more sub categories.

## Code
Use monospaced fonts for short code snippets and settings. Use gists for longer bits of code.

## Headings
Follow semantic headings. So, a heading 1 is followed by a heading 2 – and not a heading 3, 4, or 5.

**We use sentence-case capitalisation** in headings instead of title case. So, capitalise the first word (and any proper nouns), but not every word in a heading:

Sentence-case examples:
- Running a user-experience workshop
- Using CSS for site layout
- Creating Contensis templates

Title-case examples to avoid:
- Finding the Right People for your Team
- Inserting Scripts into a Template

## Layout
A good rule of thumb is to consider your mobile readers from the start. 
Do you like swiping through pages of text when reading on a smartphone? Didn’t think so.

Avoid having more than 2 or 3 paragraphs in succession without a break.
- Use images, lists and pull-quotes to break up the page.
- Use sub headings every few paragraphs to provide structure to the document and to aid skim reading.

## Links
Meaningful link text makes pages more friendly for visitors (especially those using screen readers) and search engines. The link text should always describe what the user will see when they click on it. It should never be "Click Here", "Here", or the URL itself. 

For example, if you want to link to a page about permissions, don't do this:

...an administrator needs to setup their permissions. Read more about permissions <a href="https://zenhub.zengenti.com/Contensis/9/kb/setup-and-configuration/Administration/permissions.aspx">here</a>.

**Do this, instead:**

...an administrator needs to setup their <a href="https://zenhub.zengenti.com/Contensis/9/kb/setup-and-configuration/Administration/permissions.aspx">permissions</a>.

## Paragraphs
Use blank lines to demarcate paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a paragraph.

## Poster images
Make sure they’re compressed for web. Try to avoid images with white edges as this causes the image to bleed into the page. If you can't avoid white edges, add a grey stroke (in the HTML code).

Poster images for ZenHub videos need to be 1280 x 720px.

## Tables
- Do not use bold headings
- Headings shall always be in a `<thead>`
- Table body shall always be in a `<tbody>`
- Tables need captions (right click, properties, add caption)
- Don’t have p tags in table contents i.e. `<td>Hello</td>` not `<td><p>hello</p></td>`

## Underlining
Never underline anything.

## Video
Typically videos are inserted below the intro paragraph on a ZenHub page. Choose a good poster image.

## URLS
We use lowercase characters in out URL structures in all cases.

e.g. https://zenhub.zengenti.com/contensis/r83/kb/assets-uploadable-content/video/insert-a-video.aspx
