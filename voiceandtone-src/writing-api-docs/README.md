# API documentation overview
Because our APIs are written in American English, their documentation should also be in American English so no mismatches happen between API naming conventions and articles.

Our documentation is written using markdown and is rendered using GitBooks.

## Why we use markdown
We primarily use [standard markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing documentation, with a sprinkling of Github Flavoured Markdown to add clarity. We use markdown for the following reasons. You can review our [markdown conventions](/markdown-conventions.md) for more detail.

- Markdown is easy to edit in any text editor.
- It has become the standard for developer documentation.
- Markdown can easily be parsed into any format.
- Our documentation source is public on GitHub, allowing pull requests by our clients and anyone using our APIs.
- It allows us to focus on writing our documentation instead of focussing on how looks.
