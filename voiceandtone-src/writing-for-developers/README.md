# Developer documentation

As our APIs are written in American English. Documentation of our APIs should also be in American English to ensure that no mismatches occur between API naming conventions and those referenced in any articles.

We primarily use [standard markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writing documentation, with a sprinkling of Github Flavoured Markdown to add clarity. We use markdown for the following reasons.

- Markdown is easily editable in any code / text editor
- It has become the standard for developer documentation
- Markdown can easily be parsed into any format
- Our documentation source is public on GitHub allowing pull requests by our clients and anyone using our APIs.
- It allows us to focus on writing our documentation rather than focussing on how it may look.
