We would like ZenHub learning articles to be understood by everyone. This means we're writing for a general audience rather than one very familiar with particular techniques or terminology. Assume the person you're writing for doesn't delve deeper than the basics of Microsoft Word, and I mean they can just about make stuff bold or right align an address for a letter.

The audience will differ for other areas on ZenHub such as the Development / Template areas, but using this as a rule of thumb ensures we cater for the widest audience possible.

## Make your writing engaging
ZenHub is a repository of technical information about the operation of the Contensis Content Management System. The documentation lists the functions of Contensis’ various features, troubleshooting procedures and instructions for resolving common problems.

The documentation can be accessed by using the search function on each page or you can just throw your computer across the room where pink dinosaurs will use their powers to turn it into chocolate which, once consumed, will make you a level 70 computer ninja.

*Are you awake now? Good.*

That paragraph sounds like a technical writer who locks himself in a room 7 days a week, at least until the pink dinosaurs show up. Using humour and emotion (SURPRISE!) are some of the techniques we can use to engage people. These techniques, which I've listed below, aim to get your brain to pay attention by recreating what this interaction could be if it were happening in person. When we do that, information is easier to understand and remember.

- **Conversational writing style** – Use an informal, active style similar to the way you'd speak to someone in person.
- **Humour and emotion** – Using humour is great but it's sometimes hard or impossible to translate (lets think long term, at some point we may need to translate this stuff). Emotions like surprise and "I didn't know that!" (not sure what to call that emotion) might be easier to include.
- **Multiple learning styles** – Just like in school, people learn differently. Also, everyone benefits from seeing the same content expressed in multiple ways, I’m lazy and prefer video, others may like painting by numbers some will be happy to read a couple of paragraphs of text.
- **Repetition** – When you explain something in a different way with different media, you're also, obviously, repeating it which is another good way to help people remember what's important.
- **Images and video** – Using images and video to explain things along with text is not only the next best thing to being there to help in person, they are an easy way of including multiple learning styles and repetition.
- **Activities** – Especially in a tutorial, it's good to give people something useful to accomplish. It's one thing to read instructions and understand the process but it's often helpful to remind people to try things out (don't do this with articles like deleting content it may not be so helpful!).

## Pick a good title
An article's title should try to describe what the article is about. The important thing is for the first few words to be as understandable as possible, filled with keywords that are important. This will allow users to recognise what the article is about and click confidently. In addition, a title should follow these guidelines:

- Title length: Google's search results page will display up to 70 characters. Your title can be longer than this if necessary but make sure your important keywords are in the first 70 characters.
- Try to vary the way you name articles. Don't use the same verbs or phrases in every title.
- Try to not use “-ing” words. e.g. Deleting, use delete instead

## Write a good search summary / introduction
The article summary along with the title are the only things that the user has to judge whether or not an article will answer their question. We call this "User Confidence", and it directly affects the likelihood of them clicking through to the article. Even if we provide the correct article at the top of the search results list, the user needs to make the mental connection between the search query and the results we display in order for them to click through to the article.

A summary for a how-to article should include the topics covered in the article. A troubleshooting article should try to include symptoms. In addition, a summary should follow these guidelines:

- Short and to the point. Remember the Freeads paper adverts? Write it like that. Search engines cut off anything longer than 160 characters.
- Don't use "This article explains" in every summary. Vary it when possible. Some other phrases to consider:
	- We'll show you
	- We'll explain
	- This page explains
	- This article describes / outlines
	- We'll spell out
	- Always use present tense, not future such as ‘This page will show…’

## Index pages and articles
If the article you are writing can be explained various ways you should break up each method into separate articles. Each section can then be referenced in a table of contents e.g. creating content using the navigator, creating content using a wizard. Don't include every step in the table of contents as it will reduce the scalability of the page.
## Use descriptive heading titles
Articles are likely to be comprehensive so it's important to use descriptive headings to help people find the part of the article that they need. Take a look at your table of contents. Does it work with the introduction to give you a nice overview of the scope of the article?
Make step-by-step instructions easy to follow
The main thing to keep in mind when writing step-by-step instructions is to be careful to include all the actions needed to complete the task. If, for example, you have to click "OK" after applying a setting in order to move to the next step, be sure to include clicking OK as part of that step.

Some additional things to consider:

- There are always multiple ways to achieve a result. We should always pick the most user-friendly way, don't show something in the management console if it can be achieved using the navigator.
- Use full sentences when describing how to access the user interface, don’t just say Management Console instead ‘Click the cog icon in the top toolbar or in the navigator panel to open the management console’
- Include expected results when giving instructions (for example, Click OK and the window will close).

## Adding Screenshots
Ideally learning articles should be written to work without screenshots, however they do make things easier for novice users.
### What makes a good screenshot?
- Screenshots illustrate a procedure that's difficult to understand. You don't have to have a screenshot for every step - just the ones where you want to make sure someone doesn't miss an important detail.
- They include enough context that someone can tell what part of the interface they are viewing, don't include the whole screen if its unnecessary, crop to the area thats valid.

## Content Tuning
So you’ve written a support article, but it doesn’t end there. You will need to fine tune your content to ensure it appears in the search as expected. Try some search terms that user may use.

The following will need to be tweaked when our own search control is setup, but provides some outline search techniques for improving Google rankings.

- Make articles interesting in the search results, so ensure titles attract a users attention and the description is compelling.
- Modifying titles to include the appropriate keywords.
- Changes search descriptions and ensure that it includes the primary keyword used in the title.
- Tweak the body copy, again ensure the primary content keyword is used, but don't use unnecessarily as this can cause unexpected search results due to weightings. Concise, shorter articles articles are more likely to appear due to keyword weighting.
- Don't populate an article with lots of extra metadata keywords, ensuring the title and description includes the core keyword will significantly improve the article being ranked. Use additional keywords sparingly to push an article to the top.

## Checklist
Below is a list of things you need to do before submitting a new article for review.

- Does the article have an introduction explaining what the feature is, or what the article aims to achieve.
- Read through the article, does it flow? Is it easy to understand.
- Read through the article again and follow the steps, have you missed any steps?
- Has a UI method of completing a task has been defined and the equivalent code method if available?
- Have you used full sentences when describing how to access the user interface. Don’t just say Management Console instead ‘Press the cog icon in the top toolbar or in the navigator panel to open the management console’
- Include expected results when giving instructions (for example, Press OK and the window will close).
- Are screens in italic? e.g. the Placeholder Properties screen will open
- Are actions in bold? e.g. press Save
- Are code snippets/settings in  monospaced font?
- Is the HTML clean and semantic? Use the HTML editor to check.
- Run a speel check in the editor (yes, speel on purpose)
- Syntax highlighting
- Have the appropriate relates articles been linked to?
- Are multi line Code examples using the Syntax highlighter?
- Are single line code example or tags using the `<code>` tag.
