We want our content to be understood by everyone. This means we're writing for a general audience rather than one very familiar with particular techniques or terminology. Assume the person you're writing for doesn't delve deeper than the basics of Microsoft Word, unless you are writing something like developer documentation.

## Consider your audience
Always bear in mind what you are trying to say and who you are addressing. You’re not writing for yourself, and you shouldn’t be writing for your boss – you’re writing for your visitors. Why should they care what you are saying? 

### User personas
A user persona is a character that represents the mindset of a similar, and significant, group of people. Personas are useful when deciding how to best serve the needs of your audience. If you want to know more about personas check out our <a href="https://zengenti.com/en-gb/site/downloads/Writing-for-the-Web-eBook2.2.pdf">Writing for the Web eBook</a>.

### User stories
User stories are used in agile software development to help teams define the requirements they need to build. They specify – in detail – what a user needs to do with the software without saying how it can be accomplished. User stories help to keep your different end users at the front of your mind. The chances are that these users will have different priorities and a variety of needs. When you create content, make sure you are addressing these needs.

## Brevity and simplicity
People read differently online. The majority of people don’t read a whole web page – they scan it. Other than in blogs, we rarely get the opportunity to hold the attention of our audience for more than a few seconds. 

Short sentences are easier to read. So, keep your longest sentences to around 14 words.

Even highly literate people prefer clear language. Make your writing as simple as possible by limiting yourself to the <a href="http://splasho.com/upgoer5/phpspellcheck/dictionaries/1000.dicin">1000 most commonly used words</a> when you can. Try replacing difficult or unfamiliar words with more common ones. This will make your content more readable.


## Make your writing engaging
- **Conversational writing style** – Use an informal, active style similar to the way you'd speak to someone in person.
- **Humour and emotion** – Using humour is great but it's sometimes hard or impossible to translate (lets think long term, at some point we may need to translate this stuff). Emotions like surprise and "I didn't know that!" (not sure what to call that emotion) might be easier to include.
- **Multiple learning styles** – Just like in school, people learn differently. Also, everyone benefits from seeing the same content expressed in multiple ways, I’m lazy and prefer video, others may like screenshots or gifs and some will be happy to read a couple of paragraphs of text.
- **Repetition** – When you explain something in a different way with different media, you're also, obviously, repeating it which is another good way to help people remember what's important.
- **Images and video** – Using images and video to explain things along with text is not only the next best thing to being there to help in person, they are an easy way of including multiple learning styles and repetition.

## Pick a good title
A title should try to describe what the following content is about. The important thing is for the first few words to be as understandable as possible, filled with keywords that are important. This will allow users to recognise what the content is about and click confidently. In addition, a title should follow these guidelines:

- Title length: Google's search results page will display up to 70 characters. Your title can be longer than this if necessary but make sure any important keywords are in the first 70 characters.
- Try to vary the way you name content. Don't use the same verbs or phrases in every title.
- Try to not use “-ing” words. e.g. Deleting, use delete instead

## Write a good search summary / introduction
The summary or introduction along with the title might be the only things that the reader uses to judge whether or not a piece of content is what they are looking for. We call this "User Confidence", and it directly affects the likelihood of them clicking through to the content. A summary should be short and to the point. Remember the Freeads paper adverts? Write it like that. Search engines cut off anything longer than 160 characters.

## Use descriptive heading titles
Look closely at your headings, do they work with the introduction to give you a nice overview of the scope of the content?
