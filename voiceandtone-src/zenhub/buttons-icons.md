# Buttons
When referring to specific buttons or icons in documentation – use a consistent name.

- If a button is labelled (e.g. Save), always use the label
- If an icon isn’t labelled (e.g. Management Console), refer to it consistently:
- Management Console – not “Cog icon,” the cog, etc
- Project Search – not the spyglass, the search icon
- When referring to a button, use of capitals is acceptable (to maintain consistency with Contensis UI)
